/** Underlying Engine
 *
 * Phase 1: Analysis
 * The Spark SQL engine begins by generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the SQL or DataFrame query.
 * In this initial phase, any columns or table names will be resolved by consulting an internal Catalog,
 * a programmatic interface to Spark SQL that holds a list of names of columns, data types, functions, tables, databases, etc.
 * Once they’ve all been successfully resolved, the query proceeds to the next phase.
 *
 * Phase 2: Logical optimization
 * This phase comprises two internal stages. Applying a standard rule based optimization approach,
 * the Catalyst optimizer will first construct a set of multiple plans and then, using its cost-based optimizer (CBO),
 * assign costs to each plan. These plans are laid out as operator trees; they may include,
 * for example, the process of constant folding, predicate pushdown, projection pruning, Boolean expression simplification, etc.
 * This logical plan is the input into the physical plan.
 *
 * Phase 3: Physical planning
 * In this phase, Spark SQL generates an optimal physical plan for the selected logical plan,
 * using physical operators that match those available in the Spark execution engine.
 *
 * Phase 4: Code generation
 * The final phase of query optimization involves generating efficient Java bytecode to
 * run on each machine. Because Spark SQL can operate on data sets loaded in memory,
 * Spark can use state-of-the-art compiler technology for code generation to speed up
 * execution. In other words, it acts as a compiler. Project Tungsten, which facilitates
 * whole-stage code generation, plays a role here.
 * Just what is whole-stage code generation? It’s a physical query optimization phase that
 * collapses the whole query into a single function, getting rid of virtual function calls
 * and employing CPU registers for intermediate data. The second-generation Tungsten
 * engine, introduced in Spark 2.0, uses this approach to generate compact RDD code
 * for final execution. This streamlined strategy significantly improves CPU efficiency
 * and performance.
